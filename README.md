# arch-script
A script to configure Arch linux with i3-gaps installed.

You need to have i3-gaps installed.
I recommend the "archinstall" method.

# How to install
Install git: sudo pacman -S git
Clone repository: git clone https://github.com/B1azA/arch-script.git
Go to folder: cd arch-script
Give script privileges: sudo chmod +x setup.sh
Run script: ./setup.sh

To change theme run: lxappearance

And that's all!
